<h1>Gloss tutorial</h1>

<p>Want to get started with Gloss the easy way? Then just start coding - you'll find Gloss has lots of cool surprises in store that you can pick up over time, so you should only need to dive into the documentation on rare occasions.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we're going to whizz over most of the basic features of Gloss so you can see just how it works. Begin by creating a new directory on your desktop and calling it "glosstest". Download the latest gloss.py file and place it into that directory, then create in there a new file called "glosstest.py". Open that in your text editor of choice, because this is where you're going to do all your coding.</p>

<p>The most basic Gloss game needs to create a class inheriting from the GlossGame class, then call run() on it, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
from gloss import *

class GlossTest(GlossGame):
	pass
		
game = GlossTest("Test-driving Gloss")
game.run()
</pre>

<p>The "Test-driving Gloss" parameter will be used as the title of the game window. As soon as you call run(), the game window will appear (filled with a light blue color), and that's about it. By default Gloss creates a window sized at 1280x720 (aka 720p), but you can change that by setting the screen_resolution and full_screen properties before calling run(), like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
Gloss.screen_resolution = 640,480
Gloss.full_screen = True
game.run()
</pre>

<p>Moving on, let's change that to a black background:</p>

<pre class="command">
class GlossTest(GlossGame):
	def draw(self):
		Gloss.clear(Color.BLACK)
</pre>

<p>Or, to make it a little prettier, we could use a background gradient like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
	def draw(self):
		Gloss.fill(top = Color.WHITE, bottom = Color.BLACK)
</pre>

<p>Let's that a step further by filling the background with a texture loaded from a local file. Inside the Gloss download you should see an "examples" directory that includes several scripts demonstrating Gloss functionality, and inside there is a "content" directory containing some basic artwork used in those examples. Copy that whole "content" directory into the same place as your glosstest.py script so that you have access to all that example art.</p>

<p>Now, when your game starts, Gloss will automatically look for and call a load_content() method if you have created one. This is your chance to load all your assets and perform any other configuration you want to do. For this example, we're going to load a background texture from the "content" directory, so add this method to your GlossTest class:

<pre class="command">
def load_content(self):
	self.tex_background = Texture("content/background.jpg")
</pre>

<p>Then you should change your fill() call in draw() so that it uses that new texture, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
Gloss.fill(self.tex_background)
</pre>

<p>If you've made it this far, your code should look like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
from gloss import *

class GlossTest(GlossGame):
	def load_content(self):
		self.tex_background = Texture("content/background.jpg")

	def draw(self):
		Gloss.fill(self.tex_background)

		
game = GlossTest("Test-driving Gloss")
game.run()
</pre>

<p>For more advanced users, you can also load a Gloss texture from a Pygame surface. We won't be doing that in this tutorial, but for the sake of completeness here's how it looks:</p>

<pre class="command">
from pygame import *
from gloss import *

class GlossTest(GlossGame):
	def load_content(self):
		mysurface = image.load("content/background.jpg")
		self.tex_background = Texture(mysurface)
</pre>

<h2>Fun with sprites</h2>

<p>Let's move onto something more interesting: drawing a sprite. Add these two lines to your load_content() method:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.tex_gem = Texture("content/gem.png")
self.spt_gem = Sprite(self.tex_gem, position = (100, 100))
</pre>

<p>That loads a gem texture, creates a sprite using it, then places that sprite at 100,100. To draw that sprite, just add this line to your draw() method:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.spt_gem.draw()
</pre>

<p>Because we're calling draw() without any parameters, Gloss will use the sprite's position (100,100), which is usually what you want.</p>

<p>The draw() method of your game automatically gets called by Gloss every frame, allowing you to render your game to the screen. If you want to update things in your game, eg moving this new sprite, you shouldn't put that code here. Instead, create an update() method inside your game's class, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
def update(self):
	self.spt_gem.position.move(1.0, 0.0)
</pre>

<p>That will shuffle the gem to the right slowly, which is a little bit dull. Note that Gloss will call your update() and draw() methods 60 times a second, giving you a fixed 60 frames per second; if that's not possible because your game is too complicated for the player's computer, Gloss.running_slowly is set to true until the 60 FPS is restored.</p>

<p>Let's spice things up by making the gem move using interpolation - that means we specify a start position, an end position, and what is essentially a percentage along that path, leaving Gloss to figure out where the gem should be. Add this line in load_content():</p>

<pre class="command">
self.eggs = 0.0
</pre>

<p>Now put these four lines in your Draw method():</p>

<pre class="command">
self.eggs += 0.005
if (self.eggs > 1.0):
	self.eggs = 0.0

self.spt_gem.position.move_to(Gloss.lerp(100, 1000, self.eggs), None)
</pre>

<p>The first three are there to add 0.005 to self.eggs every frame, resetting it to 0 if it goes over 1.0. The last one is our linear interpolation (or "lerp"), which will make the gem move from X 100 to X 1000 depending on how high the self.eggs variable is. In this example, if self.eggs is 0, lerp() will return 100. If self.eggs is 1, lerp() will return 1000. For ranges inbetween 0 and 1, lerp() will return equivalent ranges between 100 and 1000.</p>

<p>If lerping is a little too tame for you, try changing lerp() for smooth_step(), which uses a sigmoid curve so that the movement starts off slow, picks up pace towards the middle, then slows down smoothly towards the end - just like the Easing option does in Adobe Flash:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.spt_gem.position.move_to(Gloss.smooth_step(100, 1000, self.eggs), None)
</pre>

<p>Using that code, the gem should glide smoothly across the screen. But there's a lot more we can do with that gem - try going back to the self.spt_gem.draw() call and changing it to this:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.spt_gem.draw(rotation = self.eggs * 360)
</pre>

<p>That will cause the gem to spin across the screen, but you'll notice it does so in a strange wobbly line - that's because the default origin (where the sprite is drawn and rotated from) is the top-left of the texture. That means if you draw a sprite on the screen at 0,0 its top-left edge will touch the top-left edge of the screen.</p>

<p>It's because the sprite is being spun around that top-left corner that we have the wobbly path, so to fix that we just need to tell Gloss to use the centre of the sprite as its origin. You can do this by using the half_width and half_height values of the sprite's texture (ie self.spt_gem.texture.half_width), but that's a lot to type, so Gloss has a shortcut - just pass the "origin" parameter as None to have Gloss automatically use the centre of the sprite for positioning and rotation.</p>

<p>So, change that sprite draw() call to this:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.spt_gem.draw(rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None)
</pre>

<p>Let's make the gem look more interesting by changing its size. To do this, just specify the "scale" parameter to its draw() method, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
scale = 3
</pre>

<p>That will cause the gem to be drawn at three times its size. But seeing as we already have the self.eggs value changing every frame, we can use that to make the gem change size as it moves, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.spt_gem.draw(rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = self.eggs * 2)
</pre>

<p>Now the gem will start off very small, and grow up to twice its original size by the time it reaches the end of its path.</p>

<p>Having a plain white gem might look a bit dull, so if you want to have gems of multiple colors in your game just ask Gloss to recolor them for you as needed. No, this isn't slow - in fact, you can color every sprite any color you want and it's basically free in terms of processing time. For example, if you want to make our white gem green-colored, add this to your spt_gem.draw() call:</p>

<pre class="command">
color = Color.GREEN
</pre>

<p>Of course, it's important to remember that the alpha value (opacity) is also a component of color, which means you can make things transparent just by specifying an alpha value lowering than 1. For example:</p>

<pre class="command">
# 100% green with full alpha
color = Color(0, 1, 0, 1)

# 100% green with half alpha
color = Color(0, 1, 0, 0.5)

# 50% green with 25% alpha
color = Color(0, 0.5, 0, 0.25)
</pre>

<p>Or if you want something really fancy, try using the lerp() method of Color, which interpolates between two colors smoothly. For example:</p>

<pre class="command">
color = Color.lerp(Color.WHITE, Color.TRANSPARENT_WHITE, self.eggs)
</pre>

<p>That will cause the gem to fade away as it gets larger.</p>


<h2>Tracking mouse clicks</h2>

<p>If you're working with a game controller or the keyboard, you'll probably want to write your own code to let players select things on the screen. But working with mouse input can be tricky, particularly because Gloss can scale and rotate items, which means simple code to check for clicks just doesn't work. To make your life easier, Gloss can do mouse selection for you in two different ways: sprite selection and whole-screen selection.</p>

<p>Let's start with sprite selection, as it's the one you'll probably find yourself using most often. We're going to update our code so that the gem stops moving when it is clicked on, then starts moving when it's clicked on again. First, create a variable to store whether the gem should be moving - add this to load_content():</p>

<pre class="command">
self.sprite_is_moving = True
</pre>

<p>And now modify update() so that Egg is only incremented wth sprite_is_moving is true, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
if self.sprite_is_moving:
	self.eggs += 0.005
</pre>

<p>To toggle whether the sprite is moving, we need to ask Gloss to call a function whenever our sprite is clicked. We think you'll find this pleasantly simple to do - just modify your load_content() method to this:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.tex_gem = Texture("content/gem.png")
self.spt_gem = Sprite(self.tex_gem, position = (100, 100))
self.spt_gem.on_click = self.my_function
self.sprite_is_moving = True
</pre>

<p>"my_function" is a custom function you can write, that will be called whenever the sprite is clicked. That function needs to accept the sprite as a parameter, which seem a bit silly because you're attaching it to a sprite so clearly you already know which sprite is clicked! But actually it's very helpful, because it means you can attach the same function to several sprites, then use that parameter to figure out which sprite was clicked.</p>

<p>So, we need to create my_function() - put this new method into your class:</p>

<pre class="command">
def my_function(self, sprite):
	self.sprite_is_moving = not self.sprite_is_moving
</pre>

<p>And that's it. No, really - go ahead and run the game now and you can click on the gem to make it start and stop moving.</p>

<p>The other way to do click tracking is whole-screen selection, which is where you ask Gloss what sprite exists on a certain part of your screen, and it either returns the sprite to you or None if nothing was there.</p>

<p>To use this selection system, just call Gloss.select_object() passing in X/Y co-ordinates as a list, eg (0, 0) is the top-left corner of the screen. To demonstrate this, we're going to make a few changes all at once: we're going to load a new texture (a little cloud), then create a new sprite that uses the existing gem texture and moves like the current gem. Here's the code:</p>

<pre class="command">
from gloss import *

class GlossTest(GlossGame):
	def load_content(self):
		self.tex_background = Texture("content/background.jpg")

		self.tex_gem = Texture("content/gem.png")
		self.tex_cloud = Texture("content/cloud.png")
		self.spt_gem = Sprite(self.tex_gem, position = (100, 100))
		self.spt_gem2 = Sprite(self.tex_gem, position = (100, 200))

		self.eggs = 0.0

	def draw(self):
		Gloss.fill(self.tex_background)
		self.spt_gem.draw(rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = self.eggs * 2, color = Color.GREEN)
		self.spt_gem2.draw(rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = self.eggs * 2, color = Color.GREEN)

	def update(self):
		self.eggs += 0.005

		if (self.eggs > 1.0):
			self.eggs = 0.0

		self.spt_gem.move_to(Gloss.smooth_step(100, 1000, self.eggs), None)
		self.spt_gem2.move_to(Gloss.smooth_step(100, 1000, self.eggs), None)

game = GlossTest("Test-driving Gloss")
game.run()
</pre>

<p>To detect mouse clicks, what we need to do is attach a function to the on_mouse_up event for the game, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.on_mouse_up = self.handle_mouse_clicks
</pre>

<p>Put that into load_content() somewhere, and whenever the mouse is clicked on the screen the handle_mouse_clicks() method will get called. If you were wondering, you can also use the on_mouse_down event to check when the mouse button is pressed. Behind the scenes, on_mouse_down is executed first, then, when the mouse button is released, the on_mouse_up event is executed, then finally any on_click events for sprites.</p>

<p>Anyway, the handle_mouse_clicks() method needs to select the sprite at the current position on the screen. When this function is called, Gloss passes in the Pygame event that was generated for the mouse click, which includes the position of the mouse click. We can use that to select the clicked sprite and change its texture to the cloud texture, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
def handle_mouse_clicks(self, event):
	sprite = Gloss.select_object(event.pos)

	if sprite is None:
		print("No sprite clicked!")
	else:
		print("You clicked on sprite " + sprite.id)
		sprite.texture = self.tex_cloud
</pre>

<p>If you run the game now, you'll see two gems moving across the screen. When you click either of them, the gem will change into a cloud. Easy!</p>

<p>Hint: every sprite has an ID variable attached to it that is uniquely generated by Gloss. If you want to keep track of important sprites more easily, just change their IDs to something of your choosing.</p>

<h2>Adding particle effects</h2>

<p>Particle systems are a very simple special effect that remains just a little too hard for newer programmers to accomplish. So Gloss makes them very easy to do. Using Gloss, you can create and draw a particle system in just three lines of code: one to load the texture you want to use for particles, one to create the particle system and define how you want it to work, and one more to draw it.</p>

<p>First up, add these two lines to your load_content() method:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.tex_star = Texture("content/star.png")
self.part_stars = ParticleSystem(self.tex_star)
</pre>

<p>The first line loads a new texture, a star shape that's included in the example content you should have copied earlier. The second line creates a new particle system using that texture, but otherwise using default settings. To actually draw that particle system, add this line into your game's draw() method:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.part_stars.draw()
</pre>

<p>That will make the particle system update and draw itself automatically. By default, particle systems are created at 0,0 (the top-left corner of the screen, and are made up of 50 particles that are created all at once. But that behaviour is easily changed simply by specifying different parameters when creating the particle system. For example, if you want to create a new particle every 1/10th of a second, add "creationspeed = 100" when creating the particle system, like this:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.part_stars = ParticleSystem(self.tex_star, position = (640, 360), creationspeed = 100)
</pre>

<p>Now you'll get 50 initial particles followed by 10 more a second. If you're wondering why 100 works out as 1/10th of a second, it's because "creationspeed" is specified in milliseconds, of which there are 1000 in a second.</p>

<p>A very common effect in particle systems is to make particles change size over time, and that's done by specifying the "growth" parameter. By default this is 0, meaning that particles don't change size over time. But if you set it to -1, Gloss will scale particles down to -100% of their size over their life, meaning they will start at full size and shrink away to nothing. Alternatively, specify numbers above 0 to make particles get larger, which is great to simulate dissipating smoke.</p>

<p>We could spend quite some time going through all the parameters for particle systems, but it's much easier just to show you in code. For example, this next line of code creates a particle system with no initial particles, that creates new particles every 1/10th of a second, that lives for a total of 5 seconds, and the particles will shrink, be rotated at creation, and move faster than normal:</p>

<pre class="command">
ParticleSystem(self.tex_star, position = (640, 360), initialparticles = 0, creationspeed = 100,
	growth = -1.0, maxrotation = 360, maxspeed = 100, lifespan = 5000)
</pre>

<p>Whereas this next line of code creates only 20 particles, makes them live 2 seconds each (2000 milliseconds), applies a wind blowing to the right (3,0), and also applies some drag to the particles so they don't keep racing off except for the wind movement:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.part_stars = ParticleSystem(self.tex_star, position = (640, 360), initialparticles = 20,
	maxspeed = 100, particlelifespan = 2000, wind = (3,0), drag = 1)
</pre>

<p>If exploding stars don't interest you, let's try something different by combining two particles systems with the on_mouse_up event. Add these four lines to your load_content() method:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.tex_smoke = Texture("content/smoke.tga")
self.tex_fire = Texture("content/fire.tga")

self.part_smoke = None
self.part_fire = None
</pre>

<p>That will load two new example textures, then create set up two empty variables that we'll be filling with particle systems. Down in your game's draw() method, add this:</p>

<pre class="command">
if self.part_smoke is not None:
	self.part_smoke.draw()
	self.part_fire.draw()
</pre>

<p>And now all that's left is to create the particle systems, and the best way to do that is to use the on_mouse_up event handling function we created earlier: handle_mouse_clicks(). Change that method to this:</p>

<pre class="command">
def handle_mouse_clicks(self, event):
	self.part_smoke = ParticleSystem(self.tex_smoke, position = (event.pos[0], event.pos[1]),
		initialparticles = 50, growth = 1.0, maxspeed = 100, particlelifespan = 1000, wind = (1,0), drag = 1)

	self.part_fire = ParticleSystem(self.tex_fire, position = (event.pos[0], event.pos[1]),
		initialparticles = 10, growth = 1.0, maxspeed = 50, particlelifespan = 500, wind = (1,0), drag = 1)
</pre>

<p>That creates two partice systems with very similar settings, both at the position the mouse was clicked. The smoke is set to move faster, live longer and have more particles, but both the smoke and the fire have wind, drag and growth applied to them. Notice how in the draw() method the smoke is drawn before the fire, which makes the effect look pretty good.</p>

<p>To try all this out, just run the game and click anywhere on the screen to create explosions.</p>



<h2>Rendering to a texture</h2>

<p>So far all our drawing has gone straight to the screen, but more advanced users will want to take advantage of render targets, which are essentially virtual screens that you can render to, then use that rendering as a texture somewhere else. Gloss makes it very easy to use this technique, and we can demonstrate it with just a few new lines of code.</p>

<p>What we're going to do is have the screen render normally, but then when the mouse is clicked we'll enable a render target that renders everything to a texture that we'll stamp several times on the screen.</p>

<p>To get started, add these two lines of code to your load_content() method:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.rt_window = RenderTarget(1280, 720)
self.in_render_target = False
</pre>

<p>That creates a render target 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels high - the same resolution we're using for the screen.</p>

<p>And now change your handle_mouse_clicks() method to this:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.in_render_target = not self.in_render_target
</pre>

<p>We're now all set to render to the render target whenever we need to. To do that, all you need to do is call the activate() method of your render target, at which point everything that you draw will be drawn into that render target. To revert back to the main screen, just call its deactivate() method.</p>

<p>We're already doing a lot in our draw() method, so what we need to do is activate() the render target at the start of the method if in_render_target is true, then deactivate() it at the end and draw using the texture, again only if in_render_target is true. Here's how that looks in code:</p>

<pre class="command">
def draw(self):
	if self.in_render_target is True:
		# clear the main screen 
		Gloss.clear(Color.BLACK)
		self.rt_window.activate()

	# draw as normal!
	Gloss.fill(self.tex_background)
	self.spt_gem.draw(rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = self.eggs * 2, color = Color.GREEN)
	self.spt_gem2.draw(rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = self.eggs * 2, color = Color.GREEN)

	if self.in_render_target is True:
		# deactivate the render target then draw it four times on the screen
		self.rt_window.deactivate()
		self.rt_window.draw(position = (200, 200), rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = 0.5)
		self.rt_window.draw(position = (1080, 200), rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = 0.5)
		self.rt_window.draw(position = (1080, 520), rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = 0.5)
		self.rt_window.draw(position = (200, 520), rotation = self.eggs * 360, origin = None, scale = 0.5)
</pre>

<p>If you run the script now, you'll find that clicking the mouse toggles between the original, full-screen drawing and the new spinning render target system. This is a very simple example of render targets in action, but hopefully you can see just how powerful they are - you can draw a whole scene in one, then scale it, spin it or do anything else you might want to, just like a normal texture.</p>



<h2>Drawing text</h2>
<p>Gloss makes it very easy to draw text to the screen: all you need to do is load a font file, then start drawing. In the examples directory that comes with Gloss you'll find freesans.ttf, a GPL 3-licensed font produced by the Free Software Federation (see <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont</a> for more information) - let's load that into Gloss by adding this line of code into load_content():</p>

<pre class="command">
self.fnt_main = SpriteFont("content/freesans.ttf", 72)
</pre>

<p>Now you're ready to draw some text on the screen: put this into your draw() method somewhere:</p>

<pre class="command">
self.fnt_main.draw("Hello,\nworld!", scale = self.eggs * 2, color = Color.RED, letterspacing = 0, linespacing = -25)
</pre>

<p>That will draw the text "Hello, world!" across two lines, scaling it up smoothly using the self.eggs value we've used lots of times already, and coloring it red.</p>

<p>There's not a whole lot more to say about text - it's simple, it's really fast, and it works. If you want to use a special character outside of the normal range (it's limited to the most important 100 or so letters, numbers and symbols for memory reasons), check out the Font documentation.</p>


<h2>Last bits</h2>
<p>While there are lots of other things you can try in Gloss, there are four particular things you ought to at least give a shot:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scene tints - use the Gloss.set_scene_tint() method to color the whole scene at once. If, for example, you want to apply a sepia tone to your game, try using "Gloss.set_scene_tint(Color.from_bytes(210, 180, 120, 255))". If you want to make your scene fade out, use "Gloss.set_scene_tint(Color.lerp(Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK, YourLerpValueHere))", where you need to set YourLerpValueHere to a value between 0 and 1 to control your fade out.</li>
<li>Taking a screenshot - use the command Gloss.save_screenshot() and pass in the name of the file to save to.</li>
<li>Frame-independent movement - multiply any movement by Gloss.elapsed_seconds to ensure that your game runs at the same speed on every computer.</li>
<li>If you want to improve the visual quality of your game, set enable_multisampling to be True in your GlossGame object.</li>
</ul>

<p>And with that, we'll leave you to explore. Remember, the best way to use Gloss is to call each method with as few parameters as possible, only adding things as you need them - just dive in and have a play! If you get stuck by accidentally opening up a fullscreen window without knowing how to quit, use the secret Gloss quit code - hold down the left Control key and press Escape.</p>
