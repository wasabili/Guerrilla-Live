This is Gloss, the high-performance drawing system for Pygame.

To get started, all you need to do is copy gloss.py into your game's directory then
add "import gloss" to the top of your Python code. If you've never worked with
Gloss before, read the tutorial then check out the example apps - it's all
included in this download.

If you have any feedback, suggestions or bug reports, please send email
to paul.hudson@gmail.com with "Gloss" somewhere in the subject line.
